## Typescript

If your project is making use of Typescript, you can import the custom types used in the ICDS component library.
For details on the types implemented in each component, refer to the Props table on the Code page for each Component.

### Web Components and React

Types can be imported from the `@ukic/web-components` package as per the below example.

> NOTE:
> If you're using react, you do not have to add web-components as a dependency to your project, it is already installed as a dependency of `@ukic/react`.

```ts
import { IcSelectTypes, IcMenuOption } from "@ukic/web-components";

const selectType: IcSelectTypes = "single";

const options: IcMenuOption[] = [
  {
    label: "Americano",
    value: "ame",
    description: "Classic black coffee",
  },
  {
    label: "Latte",
    value: "lat",
    description: "This coffee has milk in, we know that much",
    disabled: true,
  },
];
```

### Canary

In the same manner as the main components packages, types can be imported from the `@ukic/canary-web-components` package as per the below example.

> NOTE:
> If you're using react, you do not have to add `canary-web-components` as a dependency to your project, it is already installed as a dependency of `@ukic/canary-react`.

```ts
import { IcPaginationBarOptions } from "@ukic/canary-web-components";

let paginationConfig: IcPaginationBarOptions = {
  itemsPerPageOptions: [
    { label: "5", value: "5" },
    { label: "10", value: "10" },
  ],
  showItemsPerPageControl: true,
  selectedItemsPerPage: 5,
};
```
